My name is Oliver Milke (or just Olli). Currently I live in Braunschweig, Germany. I was born in 1985, made my first attempts with a personal computer in 1995 and discovered my love for programming in 2001. I have been working in Software Development companies continously since 2006.

I received my Bachelor's Degree (1,3) in 2012/02 and have since been working in Java EE 6 environments.

Beside my passion for software development, I really enjoy cooking or playing board games with friends (or both together). In order to unwind from work I regularly go to the gym for weight lifting.

I regularly attend talks being held for [JUG Ostfalen](http://www.jug-ostfalen.de/).
