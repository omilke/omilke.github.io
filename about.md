I'm Olli and I have been passionate about coding for over a decade. My focus has been on Java backend projects, but I also enjoy trying out new and different stuff.

I'm working as team lead at <a href="https://bredex.de/" target="_blank">BREDEX</a>, however opinions expressed
on this blog are my own.


When being away from the keyboard and enjoy weight lifting or doing freeletics as well as playing board games or cooking
with friends.
