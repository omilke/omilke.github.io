I have just recently reported about new job and, to be honest, so far, my time at Triology has even exceeded my expectations.

My onboarding started with a nice small email sent the head of our HR providing answers to questions you might not 
necessarily want to ask when just joining a company. It continued with an introduction to all the colleagues and some 
common appointments with HR and IT administration. It just felt well considered and prepared accordingly.

My workplace was completely set up neatly prepared, including a bit chocolate. This made me feel welcome right from the start. By the way, each of our developers get's his or her Clean Code copy.

I'm working on our product which is soon to be released and I can image to briefly cover it when the time right. What 
I can say right now, is that it is a whole lot of fun working on it and absolutely interesting to dive into the 
technology stack, which is mostly new to me ;-)

## Why do I write such an article?

You might wonder, why I am writing this article. I can admit, that I would when reading such an article. However, I 
have experienced some onboarding processes myself due to the fairly high number of employers I have worked for, including super small (< 10 people) and super large companies like VW and some in between. Never before have I felt so warmly welcome with the onboarding procedure and I was just totally amazed. On the other hand, this is the first development job in which providing supreme tools is out of question.
